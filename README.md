Motivational Posters
=====================

First day at Makers Academy web development course. The objective of this project was to get an idea of what could be done using Sinatra, ruby, javascript, css and html.

The program can search for a image using google images search results and lets you pick one so you can build your motivational poster adding the text that you want.
